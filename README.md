# Process-Scheduler-
The code simulates the execution of processes with different scheduling policies, including FCFS (First-Come, First-Served), SJF (Shortest Job First), and RR (Round Robin). The code takes input from an input file, where each line represents a process with a name, priority, and burst time. The code then schedules and executes these processes based on the specified scheduling policy and tracks various statistics like turnaround time and waiting time for each process.
